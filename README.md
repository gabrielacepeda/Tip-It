A simple app that lets you select desired tip percentage and then the total number of people splitting the bill.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this app. On page load, the user can the weather is displayed using your location, as well as the current time.


## Lessons Learned:

I'd never worked with Photoshop and psd files, so was able to play around more easily with images and designs.
